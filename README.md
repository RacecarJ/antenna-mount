Antenna mounts for the F1/10 and MIT RACECAR versions of RACECAR/J

This repository contains the original F1/10 antenna design and STL files for the F1/10th racecar (https://f1tenth.org/). The original files are in the directory antenna_mount.

There are two other directories. The first, F110, contains two sets of file. There are two sets of files (BaseAntennaMount), the first is a slightly modified version of the original design file based on the F1/10 design in Fusion 360. The modification changes the mounting hole for the RP-SMA jack to a standard panel cutout. The second set (WideAntennaMount) is a variation which distances the antennas 32mm apart to help avoid interference in the 2.4GHz range.

The other directory, MITRACECAR, holds an alternate design to the F1/10 modified to fit the spacing on the MIT upper platform plate. 

Holes on the upper platform are spaced 1/2" apart. The mounting holes on the antenna bracket are 1" (25.4mm) apart, 5 mm in diameter. In order to mount the bracket, overdrill two of the holes that are an inch apart to 5mm. Use a 5mm automotive panel fastener (Christmas tree) to fasten the bracket to the panel.
